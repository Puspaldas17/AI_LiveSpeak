AI-Powered Real-Time Event Captioning
### **Project Title:**
**LiveSpeak â€“ AI-Powered Real-Time Event Captioning**
---
### **Abstract:**
LiveSpeak is an AI-driven platform designed to provide **real-time captions for live events, online meetings, and lectures**, making content more accessible and inclusive. Leveraging advanced speech-to-text technologies, the system captures spoken audio, transcribes it instantly, and displays captions to viewers in a web interface. This ensures that audiences, including those with hearing impairments or non-native speakers, can follow along seamlessly. LiveSpeak supports live audio input as well as pre-recorded clips, allowing users to generate accurate captions in multiple formats. By combining ease of use, accessibility, and real-time performance, LiveSpeak bridges communication gaps and enhances audience engagement in digital and physical events.

### **Proposed Solution:**
LiveSpeak works as a **web-based application** with a simple and intuitive interface:
1. **Audio Capture:** Users can speak directly via a microphone or upload audio/video clips.
2. **Real-Time Processing:** Audio streams are processed using AI-based speech-to-text APIs (like Whisper or Google Speech-to-Text), converting speech into text in near real-time.
3. **Live Caption Display:** Transcribed text is shown immediately on the screen with smooth scrolling, optionally with speaker identification.
4. **Transcript Management:** Users can save, edit, or download the transcript for documentation, accessibility, or sharing purposes.
5. **Multi-Language Support (Optional):** Captions can be translated to other languages using integrated translation APIs for international audiences.
The solution emphasizes **low latency, high accuracy, and user-friendly design**, ensuring that both event organizers and viewers can benefit without technical complexity.
