AI-Powered Real-Time Event Captioning

Project Title:
LiveSpeak – AI-Powered Real-Time Event Captioning

---

Abstract:

LiveSpeak is an AI-driven platform designed to provide real-time captions for live events, online meetings, and lectures, making content more accessible and inclusive. Leveraging advanced speech-to-text technologies, the system captures spoken audio, transcribes it instantly, and displays captions to viewers in a web interface. This ensures that audiences, including those with hearing impairments or non-native speakers, can follow along seamlessly. LiveSpeak supports live audio input as well as pre-recorded clips, allowing users to generate accurate captions in multiple formats. By combining ease of use, accessibility, and real-time performance, LiveSpeak bridges communication gaps and enhances audience engagement in digital and physical events.

Proposed Solution:

LiveSpeak works as awe-based application with a simple and intuitive interface:

1.Audio Capture: Users can speak directly via a microphone or upload audio/video clips.
2.Real-Time Processing: Audio streams are processed using AI-based speech-to-text APIs (like Whisper or Google Speech-to-Text), converting speech into text in near real-time.
3.Live Caption Display: Transcribed text is shown immediately on the screen with smooth scrolling, optionally with speaker identification.
4.Transcript Management: Users can save, edit, or download the transcript for documentation, accessibility, or sharing purposes.
5.Multi-Language Support (Optional): Captions can be translated to other languages using integrated translation APIs for international audiences.
The solution emphasizes low latency, high accuracy, and user-friendly design, ensuring that both event organizers and viewers can benefit without technical complexity.

Innovation & Uniqueness:

*Real-Time Accessibility: Unlike traditional captioning tools that require manual input or post-processing, LiveSpeak provides instant, AI-generated captions.
*Multi-Format Support: Works with live audio streams, video recordings, and pre-recorded sessions.
*Inclusivity: Focuses on accessibility for hearing-impaired audiences and multilingual support, making events universally approachable.
*Scalable & Easy Integration: Can be extended to online classes, webinars, and public events, demonstrating versatility and practical impact.
*Portfolio-Friendly: Combines AI, web development, and UX design into a cohesive, professional project that is both demonstrable and impactful.

LiveSpeak Roadmap
Tech Stack

*Frontend: React.js (for live captions display & UI)
*Backend: Node.js + Express (for handling audio streaming & API requests)
*Database (optional): MongoDB / SQLite (to save transcripts, user sessions)
*Speech-to-Text API: OpenAI Whisper / Google Speech-to-Text / Deep gram
*Deployment: Vencel (frontend), Render/Heroku (backend)
*Optional: Translation API for multi-language captions

Module-wise Breakdown

1. Frontend (React)

*Audio Capture Module:

  * Use `navigator. mediaDevices.getUserMedia() ` to capture live microphone input.
  * Button: Start/Stop recording.
*Live Caption Display:

  * Scrollable text area showing real-time transcriptions.
  * Highlight speaker name if implementing speaker recognition later.
*Transcript Management:

  * Option to download captions as `.txt` or `.pdf`.
*UI/UX:

  * Simple, clean interface with responsive design.
  * Optional dark/light mode.

2. Backend (Node.js + Express)

*Audio Stream Endpoint:

  * Receive live audio chunks from frontend.
  * Forward them to Speech-to-Text API.
*Transcription Service:

  * Process audio → return text in real-time.
  * Optional: Store transcript in DB.
*Translation Service (Optional):

  * Translate text to multiple languages using Google Translate API or similar.
*API Routes:

  * `/upload-audio` → for pre-recorded files
  * `/live-stream` → for live audio streaming

3. Database (Optional)

* Store:

  * User sessions
  * Saved transcripts
  * Event metadata

4. Deployment

*Frontend: Deploy React app on Vercel.
*Backend: Deploy Node.js API on Render / Heroku.
*Integration: Make sure frontend calls backend endpoints securely (CORS handling, API keys).

Suggested Workflow

1.Week 1: Set up React frontend + Node backend skeleton.
2.Week 2: Implement audio capture in frontend and send audio to backend.
3.Week 3: Integrate Speech-to-Text API → show live captions in frontend.
4.Week 4: Add transcript management & optional translation.
5.Week 5: Polish UI, test latency/accuracy, deploy online.
